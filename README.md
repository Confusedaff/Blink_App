### Project Description

Do you find your eyes useful ? Do you like them,well not anymore a simple app to see(or not see) things in a new way. An app that only works when you close your eyes.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Apps today cater only to open eyes. That's descrimination. With this app we can make the world finally EQUAL.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

I first created a Python script which uses MediaPipe‚Äôs(opencv didn't work) face mesh to detect my eyes through the webcam feed, calculates how open or closed they are, and when I blink for a few frames in a row, it increments a counter. This counter is served over a mini Flask API so that any other program can ask ‚ÄúHey, is the user‚Äôs eyes open or closed and how many times have they blinked?‚Äù. It also displays the live camera feed with the EAR (Eye Aspect Ratio) and the current eye status overlay. Rest of the detaileddd nerd stuff given below.
